## Explanation

Since the streaming of music can be done throughout different webservice providers such as Google play music and apple music, it was decided that we as a user should be able to play music on our own website.

## Problem

I was brought on board to solve the problem of playin music directly from the browser so the listener could listen to the artists music for free.

## Solution

To do this, we would gather the artists old music and organize them according to their album and have their music listed per album. This list displayed is clickable and once the music is clicked, it can be played, paused and skipped. As well, albums can be rotated and switched while music is being played.


## Results

Testing was a big part of the development phase. To ensure this worked, I had to test each UI using the console log on the google chrome browser to ensure errors did not appear. If an error had appeared, the line number of where the error occured would appear in the console logs to allow me to solve this problem.

## Conclusion

Playing music through the browser worked and switching between the different songs worked. However, some of the doubts going into the projects were whether or not if switching between songs would cause for the old song to keep playing over the new song. I would try to clean up my code to ensure its easy to read by another user and that it works well. I learned jQuery from scratch for this project.
